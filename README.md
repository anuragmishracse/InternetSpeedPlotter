# InternetSpeedPlotter
One day, the internet speed of my college was fluctuating. I wasn't able to do anything. So, I thought of making a script to observe the internet speed of my college over a period of a one day(24 hrs) and plotted a graph.&lt;br>The result was pretty interesting. I observed that the sweet spot to use internet is the night-time i.e. between 2am - 4am.
